#### Ingredients

- **Ham:**  2 cups with bone if you can get it
- **Celery:** 1/2 cup
- **White beans:** 1/2 cup
- **Water:**  to cover everything
- **Carrots:** 1 cup
- **Onion:** 1/2 large onion chopped finely
- **Potato:** 3  medium
- **Green beans:** 1/2 cup this is optional



#### Instructions

- There is so much flavor and salt in the ham you don't need to add chicken broth.  Just cover everything with water and let it cook until the meat falls off the bone.  
- You may want to add the potato towards the end so they don't cook down into mush.  It all depends on how long you leave this on the stove.   Red potatoes will hold their shape longer than white or russets.  
- Cook it hard for a half an hour and then let it slow simmer until it is perfect.
